# Tutorial to analyse RNA-seq data

This tutorial will cover from the raw data obtained with Salmon, to different analyses such as PCA plots, log2FC comparisons, or functional enrichment. The main programming language will be R, and although a basic knowledge is required to follow this tutorial, I will try to explain every piece of code.

The backbone of this tutorial is the R package DESeq2, which is a package that allows you to perform all the statistical comparisons of interest in a very powerful and simple way.
